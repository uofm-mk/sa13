            <p> James Harden might be the second best shooting guard of all time. The scoring numbers he put up in Houston during his MVP season have not been matched at any point in NBA history. At one time he averaged 50 points over a 3 game stretch.</p>

            <p> Ja Morant is nothing but a liability for the Memphis Grizzlies. He initially was only supposed to miss 20 games this season due to an off court incident. After returning he then had a season ending injury taking them from a playoff contender to an absolutely garbage team. He needs to go ASAP!</p>
